# GCP Without Web Console Demo

This repository demonstrates how to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without using the web console. It provides various examples and approaches for managing GCP resources programmatically.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- **[shell_scripts](./shell_scripts)**: Contains individual gcloud CLI commands for creating and managing single resources.
- **[tasks](./tasks)**: Contains complete mini-project configurations with multiple resources.
- **[terraform](./terraform)**: Contains infrastructure as code for a complete project with multiple resources.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning resource and reference for DevOps engineers, cloud administrators, and developers who want to:

1. Automate GCP resource provisioning and management
2. Implement infrastructure as code practices
3. Learn different approaches to GCP resource management (CLI, scripts, Terraform)
4. Understand GCP resource relationships and dependencies

## Prerequisites

To use the examples in this repository, you'll need:

1. A Google Cloud Platform account
2. Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) installed and configured
3. Terraform installed (for the terraform examples)
4. Appropriate GCP permissions and credentials

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your GCP credentials and project
3. Explore the different directories based on your needs:
   - Use `shell_scripts` for simple, single-resource operations
   - Use `tasks` for more complex, multi-resource operations
   - Use `terraform` for complete infrastructure management

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the examples or add new ones are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
